# Bot for Teknologi Umum

Basically a _bleeding edge_ telegram bot to fulfill Teknologi Umum's _bleeding edge_ needs. Teknologi Umum is an Indonesian telegram group made for people to talk about.. basically anything, tbh. You can join through [this link](https://t.me/teknologi_umum). First thing you need to do is mute the group, it's effing noisy.

What can this bot do? Well, _bleeding edge_ stuffs! You'll find everything when you interact with [the bot on Telegram](https://t.me/TeknologiUmumBot).

Feel free to contribute and add some _bleeding edge_ features.

To make it even more _bleeding edge_, we're using [fly.io](https://fly.io/) for deployment on Node v16. Oh, and we're going so much _bleeding edge_ by doing as little tests as possible lmao.

## How To Run this Codebase?

- You need NodeJS, Telegram account, and Redis on your device.
- Setup credentials (you can see the example [here](/.env.example)).
- To obtain a Telegram Token, you will need to create a bot at BotFather on Telegram.
- Go to this repository directory and run `npm install` on your terminal.
- Finally, run `npm start` to activate the bot.

See [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more detailed instruction.
