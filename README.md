# Bot for Teknologi Umum

Basically a _bleeding edge_ telegram bot to fulfill Teknologi Umum's _bleeding edge_ needs. Teknologi Umum is an Indonesian telegram group made for people to talk about.. basically anything, tbh. You can join through [this link](https://t.me/teknologi_umum). First thing you need to do is mute the group, it's fucking noisy.

Feel free to contribute and add some _bleeding edge_ features.

To make it even more _bleeding edge_, we're using [fly.io](https://fly.io/) for deployment and Node v16. Oh, and we're going so much _bleeding edge_ by not doing any tests at all lmao.

## How To Running this Codebase?

- You've need NodeJS, Telegram account, and Redis.
- Setup credential (you can see the example [here](/.env.example)).
 - To obtain a Telegram Token, you need to create a bot at Bot Father on Telegram.
- Go to this codebase directory and run npm install or yarn install on your terminal.
- Finally, run npm start or yarn start to activate the bot.
